# Stack_UP

In this project we have reverse engineered a stock website where you are able to post your thoughts on a company. When posting it will ask you what industry it is in, the direction being either bullish or bearish, your prediction, and any additional comments you'd like to add for other to be able to read.

We decided to take on this project as we found it to present more of a challenge for us to tackle then if we were to target a more generic website. The biggest challenges we found were the start of the entire project as we were figuring out how we wanted the website to present itself, as we went through with the building we found issues with how it would all connect and making the nav bar work in the smoothest way possible for any user using the website to be able to navagate through with ease.

- As a user I want to be able see what stocks other people are buying and what they're saying about it
- I want to be able to place coments to specific stocks (i.e ask questions about a certain prediction)
- I want to be able to post my own predictions to the site
- I want to be able to find predictions base on industry
- In order to be able to use the site, I will have to sign up or sign in
- I want to be able to comment on others posts
